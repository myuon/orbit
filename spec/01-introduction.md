# 1. Introduction

## Overview

Orbit is a statically typed programming language designed for high-performance computing with JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation capabilities. The language combines the safety of static typing with the performance of native code generation through its innovative compilation pipeline.

## Design Philosophy

Orbit is designed with the following principles:

- **Static Typing**: All types are known at compile time, enabling optimization and preventing runtime type errors
- **Performance**: JIT compilation to native AArch64 code for maximum runtime performance
- **Safety**: Strong type system prevents common programming errors
- **Simplicity**: Clean, readable syntax that is easy to learn and use
- **Generics**: Powerful generic system for code reuse without performance overhead

## Key Features

- **Static Type System**: Comprehensive type checking at compile time
- **JIT Compilation**: Native code generation for AArch64 architecture
- **Generic Programming**: Generic types and functions with monomorphization
- **Structured Programming**: Support for structs with methods
- **Built-in Data Structures**: Native support for vectors, maps, and slices
- **Memory Safety**: Controlled memory management with pointers
- **Global Variables**: Support for global state management

## Compilation Pipeline

The Orbit compiler follows a multi-stage compilation pipeline:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Source code is tokenized into a stream of tokens
2. **Parsing**: Tokens are parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Type Checking**: Type analysis and validation
4. **Desugaring**: Complex language constructs are simplified
5. **Monomorphization**: Generic types and functions are instantiated
6. **Code Generation**: IR (Intermediate Representation) is generated
7. **Execution**: Either VM interpretation or JIT compilation to native code

## Runtime Execution

Orbit supports two execution modes:

- **Virtual Machine**: Stack-based interpreter for development and debugging
- **JIT Compilation**: Direct compilation to native AArch64 machine code for production

## Language Status

Orbit is currently in active development. The core language features are implemented and stable, with ongoing work on advanced features like garbage collection, pattern matching, and module system.
